// Create a burst object pooling array
// This is so that if the burst is not yet finisched animating,
// it want stop and replay. Instead we choose the next object in the pool array.
// This is a common technique in game development to prevent triggering garbage collection
// by contantly creating new objects instead of reusing already defined ones.
// You usually only need two object to prevent the first one to stop playing,
// but I asume you as a developer just tried to click as fast as you could,
// to see if it would breake, so I added 6 objects just in case ;)
// This will create a lot of DOM elements, so if you gonna have this effect on your site,
// make sure you only have one instance of this object pool, and refere to that all the time.
// That's why I have declared it outside the React Function, to be able to get the same
// buttonBurstsPool reference in all instances of <Button /> usage throughout the site.
// Maybe moving this array to a React context would also work fine?
